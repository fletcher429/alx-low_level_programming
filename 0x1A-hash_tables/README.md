# HASH TABLES

## WHAT IS A HASH TABLE
* Is a dta structure that allowa one to store value by key retrive value by key
* Hash tables store and retrieve values by key `(1 or 1000000)` at the same speed
  making it more effecient
  It does this by preallocating number of slots/rows
## REAL LIFE EXAMPLE O A HASH TABLE
 A hash table is a data structure used for storing key-value pairs. It offers efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations. Here's a breakdown of how it works using a library as an analogy:

Imagine you have a library with many books. Each book has a unique call number (the key) and contains information (the value). Now, you want to organize these books in a way that makes it easy to find them quickly.

In your library, you decide to use a hash table. Here's how it works:

1. **Hash Function**: You have a librarian who knows how to quickly determine where each book should go. This librarian is like a hash function. A hash function takes a key (the call number) and computes a hash value (the shelf location) where the book should be placed.

2. **Shelves**: Your library has shelves labeled with different hash values. Each shelf corresponds to a possible hash value generated by the hash function.

3. **Placing Books**: When a new book arrives, the librarian uses the hash function to calculate its hash value. Then, they place the book on the shelf corresponding to that hash value.

4. **Finding Books**: When you want to find a book, you provide its call number. The librarian uses the hash function to calculate its hash value and goes directly to the shelf where books with that hash value are stored. This makes finding the book much faster than searching through the entire library.

5. **Handling Collisions**: Sometimes, two different books might have the same hash value (i.e., they map to the same shelf). This is called a collision. To handle collisions, the library might have multiple ways to store books on the same shelf. For example, they could use linked lists or other data structures to store multiple books with the same hash value.

6. **Efficiency**: With a well-designed hash function, the library can efficiently store and retrieve books. The time it takes to find a book is typically O(1), or constant time, on average, making hash tables very efficient for many applications.
